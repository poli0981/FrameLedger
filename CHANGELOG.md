# Changelog

All notable changes to FrameLedger are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — `MAJOR`
bumps for a database schema or IPC protocol break (`docs/11_UPDATER.md`).

`release.yml` reads the section for the tag being released and uses it as the
GitHub release body, so a missing section means an empty release note.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Design documents (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/01`–`20`, `legal/`) and the repository
  skeleton: solution, project stubs, CMake presets, `build.ps1` quality gate,
  CI workflows, issue and PR templates, seed detection rules.
- `docs/20_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` — audit findings that need an empirical answer
  from the P0 spike or a design decision, grouped by what they block.
- `tools/license-check.ps1` and `tools/rules-validate.ps1`, both proven to fail
  on a planted violation rather than only to pass on a clean tree.

### Fixed
- Shared-memory layout was arithmetically impossible: the header was 88 bytes
  while the control block was mapped to `0x0040`. In code `unhookRequested`
  would have aliased `faultCount`, firing the safety stop on any hook fault.
- Frame-generation detection relied on `GetFrameStatistics().PresentCount`
  exceeding the application's own present count, which cannot happen. Replaced
  with FG feature evaluations counted at the source.
- `dispatchRaysCount` was `uint16` and saturated on every ray-traced title at
  1080p or above.
- README, Disclaimer and EULA promised the no-injection capture mode is "always
  available" when it requires an elevated agent.

### Changed
- Direct3D 9 is not a Tier-1 API in v1: the Overlay is x64-only and those
  titles are almost entirely 32-bit. They are captured at Tier 2.
